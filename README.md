# Fooderra - ABB Tech Academy

## General description

Welcome to Fooderra, where you can quickly access the recipes for your favorite dishes, share your blogs with others, and explore theirs. This project marks the culmination of our journey at ABB Tech Academy. Our dedicated team, comprising Aziz Zeynalli, Tarana Aliyeva, Murad Israfilov, Sama Zeynalli, Eldar Asgarov, Kenan Guluzada, and Fagan Majidza, played a crucial role in bringing this project to life. The inspiration behind our project stems from [Foodvisor](https://www.foodvisor.io/en/). We initiated the process by creating our own Figma file, which served as a blueprint for our developers in crafting the user interface for our platform.
